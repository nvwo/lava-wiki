<span id="id1"></span><h1>Device types<a class="headerlink" href="#device-types" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>When adding devices, there is a decision to be made about what
qualifies as a distinct device type and what does not. A different
type of device can mean different things, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>different hardware.</li>
<li>different access methods (typically, bootloaders).</li>
<li>different test writer use cases, e.g. testing firmware or testing user space
performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a slight or incremental change to hardware does not
necessarily mean that the updated device must be a different device
type. Even if a change adds significant functionality, e.g. if USB
hot-plug becomes available on revision C, that does not necessarily
mean that revision C should be a different device type compared to to
revision A and B.</p>
<p>Typically, the distinction between two device types comes down to
whether the two devices can be driven in the same way at bootloader
level, from initial power on.</p>
<p>Another example to consider is <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-dtb"><span class="xref std std-term">DTB</span></a> support. If there is more
than one DTB available for a particular family of devices, this will
probably lead to multiple different device types. Also consider
whether all devices of the proposed device type can boot all DTBs
available for that type.</p>
<p>In the end, LAVA lab administrators are free to make their own choices
about what qualifies as a distinct device type. Some factors to
consider in this judgment call include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Interchangeable jobs</strong>: Does a single health check work for all
devices of this type? It is recommended to always test all of the
supported boot methods of a device type during a single health check
test job.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Interchangeable bootloaders</strong>: Some devices can change bootloader
type within a single job, allowing a single device type to meet the
needs of a variety of different use cases. There are issues to
consider here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Latency</strong>: Changing the bootloader on every test job may have
significant costs in terms of job runtime. This is particularly
noticeable in the length of time required before the actual test
can start. In such cases, it may be worth considering a
<strong>sub-type</strong> instead.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">See also</p>
<p class="last"><a class="reference internal" href="#sub-device-types"><span class="std std-ref">Device sub-types</span></a></p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Hardware lifetime of the device</strong>: Frequently, writing a new
bootloader may cause problems on some devices where the bootloader
may be stored on media which can only be written a limited number
of times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Multi-stage bootloaders</strong>: Some devices may have a first or second
stage bootloader which can then load different higher level
bootloaders. This is often described as a chained
bootloader. Depending on the types of tests desired, some admins may
choose to expose a choice of higher level bootloader or may choose
to not allow interrupting the lower stage(s). For example, some test
writers will want to test the firmware and some test writers will
only want to interact with GRUB or later.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Equivalence</strong>: Different labs may make different decisions - if you
are looking to work with an existing lab, try to follow their device
type layout and ask about how a new device should be classified
before committing to a decision in your own lab.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Test requirements</strong>: Talk to the test writers and establish
whether an apparent hardware difference is sufficient that the
device needs to be described using a different device type. Also
consider whether the test writer requirements are going to change
over time. Just because there is no current desire to test the
experimental bootloader available on one device, this does not mean
that this will remain unused in a year.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Scheduling</strong>: If two devices have the same device type, each
device needs to be able to run any test job submitted for that
device type. There is support within LAVA for encoding small
differences between devices within a single device type - see
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-device-tag"><span class="xref std std-term">device tag</span></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>LAVA support</strong>: There are some considerations which are
constrained by LAVA support, For example, the V1 dispatcher had a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kvm</span></code> device type but the improved device configuration design in
V2 made this unnecessary. If the only factor requiring two device
types is LAVA support, please <a class="reference internal" href="support.html#getting-support"><span class="std std-ref">talk to us</span></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="permanency">
<h2>Permanency<a class="headerlink" href="#permanency" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>Once a device type has been implemented, devices added and test jobs run, it
can be awkward to change the device type. Changing the device type later will
make it difficult for users to find test results across this and other devices
and may cause significant issues with data consistency.</p>
<p>Separate device types can also complicate queries and result reporting -
combining two devices which eventually end up being different device types
causes issues with a loss of history when the split is finally made.</p>
<p>It is not a good idea to split device types arbitrarily - sooner or later there
may be a requirement to look at the results of jobs across both types and
having an unnecessary device type is confusing for test writers. Use a
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-device-tag"><span class="xref std std-term">device tag</span></a> to describe small differences between devices of the same
device type where it makes sense.</p>

<span id="sub-device-types"></span><h2>Device sub-types<a class="headerlink" href="#device-sub-types" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>A balance needs to be drawn between test jobs which simply want to use a
known working build of the firmware and/or bootloader and those test jobs
where the latest build is relevant to the success or failure of the test
itself. Different test writers may have different requirements here.</p>
<p>An example of sub-types could be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">juno-uboot</span></code> compared to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">juno-firmware</span></code>. Consider the principle of <em>test one thing at a
time</em>. Let userspace test jobs run without needing to change the
bootloader, and let bootloader test jobs have the ability to update by
separating the device type into two sub-types.</p>
<p>Think about device integration here. You need to be able to interrupt the boot
process at a level below whatever you are exposing to test writers. For
example, to offer test writers the ability to modify and test the firmware, the
platform <strong>must</strong> offer a way to replace the firmware in an automatable manner.</p>

<div class="section" id="choosing-a-name-for-a-device-type">
<span id="naming-device-types"></span><h2>Choosing a name for a device type<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-a-name-for-a-device-type" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>There are some considerations for the names of a device type in LAVA.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The name of the device type in the database will be used as part of
the URL of the page covering details of that device type, so the
name <strong>must not</strong> include characters that would be encoded in a
URL. This includes whitespace, UTF-8 characters, brackets and other
common punctuation characters.</li>
<li>Hyphens and underscores are supported.</li>
<li>In general, the name should represent the hardware in a way that
uniquely separates that type from similar hardware, e.g. panda and
panda-es or imx6q-wandboard instead of just âwandboardâ.</li>
<li>Each type has a description which can be used to provide
lab-specific information, so the name does not have to include all
details.</li>
<li>Check other LAVA instances, especially if your instance is likely to
need to work with other instances with a single frontend (like
kernelci.org)</li>
<li>Choose a sensible, descriptive name that will make sense to test
writers. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">panda</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">panda-es</span></code> instead of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">panda1</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">panda2</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="matching-the-template">
<span id="template-mismatch"></span><span id="index-0"></span><h3>Matching the template<a class="headerlink" href="#matching-the-template" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The name of a device type does not need to match an available template, however
the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-device-dictionary"><span class="xref std std-term">device dictionary</span></a> for all devices <strong>must</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">extend</span></code> a template
file which exists on the instance. Templates are a lot more than configuration.
The format supports conditional logic, inheritance and other features of code.
On the master, device type templates are configured using <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-jinja2"><span class="xref std std-term">jinja2</span></a> files
in the directory:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">lava</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dispatcher</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">device</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">types</span><span class="o">/</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When creating a new device type, it is recommended to add the new template
file first and <strong>use version control</strong> to track changes then copy the template
file to the system location.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Adding a new device type template is the most complex
part of administering a LAVA instance and it can be a lot of work
(sometimes several months) to integrate a completely new device into
LAVA. V2 offers a different and wider range of support to what was
available in V1, but some devices may still need new support to be
written directly within the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lava-dispatcher</span></code> code. <strong>It may not
always be possible to automate a new device</strong>, depending on how the
device connects to LAVA, how the device is powered and whether the
software on the device allows the device to be controlled remotely.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">panda</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">panda-es</span></code> device types are separate in the Cambridge
LAVA lab. When originally introduced, there was an expectation that the
hardware differences between the devices would be relevant to how the jobs
were constructed. As it turned out, no such difference was actually exploited
by the test writers.</li>
<li>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mustang</span></code> device type can support both U-Boot and UEFI bootloaders but
not on the same machine at the same time. The bootloader can be changed, but
this is a custom process which is not manageable during a test job. In the
Cambridge lab, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mustang</span></code> implies U-Boot and a separate sub device type
called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mustang-uefi</span></code> is available for test jobs needing UEFI.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">panda</span></code> devices can support operating systems like Debian as well
as supporting Android deployments using the same bootloader in both
cases (U-Boot). Therefore, only one device type was needed here.</li>

<p>The device type exists as a django database object which can be modified using
the <a class="reference internal" href="first-devices.html#django-admin-interface"><span class="std std-ref">django admin interface</span></a>. The following fields
are supported:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Name</strong> - the name of the device type
See <a class="reference internal" href="#naming-device-types"><span class="std std-ref">Choosing a name for a device type</span></a>. It is helpful to make the device type name
similar to or the same as the name of the template file which will be
extended by the device dictionary. The scheduler logs will use the database
name, irrespective of what the device dictionaries extend. Use an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">alias</span></code>
where the device type name differs from the template name(s) in use by
devices of this type. (An Alias is one of the
<a class="reference internal" href="#device-type-descriptive-fields"><span class="std std-ref">Descriptive fields</span></a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Health check job</strong> - the YAML test job submission for a health check
See <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-health-check"><span class="xref std std-term">health check</span></a></li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - should this device type be displayed in the GUI or not?
Enabled by default - device type display can be disabled to hide the data
about the device type from the UI, without deleting the object and
associated data. The device type remains accessible in the django
administrative interface.</li>
<li><strong>Owners only</strong> - device type is only visible to owners of devices of this type
Disabled by default - enable to create a <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-hidden-device-type"><span class="xref std std-term">hidden device type</span></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Health check frequency</strong> - how often to run health checks
Each device type can run health checks at a specified frequency which can be
based on time intervals or numbers of test jobs.</li>

<span id="device-type-descriptive-fields"></span><h3>Descriptive fields<a class="headerlink" href="#descriptive-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The device type database also includes some optional fields which may be
completed by the admin to provide information for test writers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Architecture name</strong>
e.g. ARMv7, ARMv8</li>
<li><strong>Processor name</strong>

<li><strong>CPU model name</strong>
e.g. OMAP 4430 / OMAP4460</li>
<li><strong>List of cores</strong>
The number of cores on the device and the type of CPUs. In the admin
